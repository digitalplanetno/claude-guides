# /plan — Create Implementation Plan

## Purpose
Create a detailed implementation plan BEFORE writing any code.

---

## Usage

```
/plan <feature description>
```

**Examples:**
- `/plan add OAuth login with Google`
- `/plan refactor payment service to use Stripe SDK v3`
- `/plan migrate database from MySQL to PostgreSQL`

---

## When to Use

| Situation | Use /plan? |
|-----------|-----------|
| New feature | ✅ Yes |
| Multi-file refactoring | ✅ Yes |
| Database changes | ✅ Yes |
| Complex bug fix | ✅ Yes |
| One-line fix | ❌ No |
| Simple typo | ❌ No |

---

## Process

### 1. Understand Requirements
- What is the user asking for?
- What are the acceptance criteria?
- What questions need clarification?

### 2. Research Existing Code
- What files are relevant?
- What patterns does this project use?
- Are there similar implementations to reference?

### 3. Design Solution
- How will this fit into existing architecture?
- What new files/components are needed?
- What existing code needs modification?

### 4. Identify Risks
- What could go wrong?
- What are the edge cases?
- What security considerations exist?

### 5. Break Into Phases
- Small, testable chunks
- Clear dependencies between phases
- Complexity estimates

## Save Location

Plans are saved to: `.claude/scratchpad/plan-[feature-slug].md`

---

## Rules

✅ DO:
- Research existing code thoroughly
- Ask clarifying questions if unclear
- Identify ALL affected files
- Consider edge cases and errors
- Estimate complexity realistically

❌ DON'T:
- Write implementation code
- Skip security considerations
- Make assumptions — ask questions
- Rush through planning

---

## Next Steps

After plan is approved:
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/[name]`
2. Implement Phase 1
3. Test Phase 1
4. Commit: `git commit -m "feat: [description]"`
5. Repeat for each phase
