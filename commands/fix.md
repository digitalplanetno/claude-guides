## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Issue
- What is the vulnerability/problem?
- Where exactly is it? (file:line)
- What's the impact?

### 2. Analyze Context
- Read surrounding code
- Understand the intent

## Fix Templates

### SQL Injection

```php
// Before (vulnerable)
DB::select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = " . $request->id);

// After (safe)
DB::select("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [$request->id]);
```

### XSS

```tsx
// Before (vulnerable)
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: userInput}} />

// After (safe)
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput)}} />
```

### Missing Auth

```typescript
// Before (unprotected)
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const data = await request.json();
  // ...
}

// After (protected)
import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
  if (!session) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
  }
  const data = await request.json();
  // ...
}
```

### N+1 Query

```php
// Before (N+1)
$users = User::all();
foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->posts->count(); // N queries!
}

// After (eager loading)
$users = User::with('posts')->get();
foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->posts->count(); // 0 additional queries
}
```
